# Custom Decoders

Custom decoders are added only when native Wazuh parsing is insufficient.

At this stage of the lab:
- Default Wazuh decoders provide adequate coverage
- No custom decoders are required

Decoder development may be introduced in later phases if new log sources
or parsing gaps are identified.
