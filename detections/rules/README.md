# Custom Rules

This directory contains custom Wazuh rules created to support specific
detection use cases in this lab.

Rules are intentionally limited to:
- High-signal behaviors
- Clear threat models
- Audit-friendly logic

Additional rules will be added during Phase 5.2 as part of
SIEM tuning and detection quality work.
